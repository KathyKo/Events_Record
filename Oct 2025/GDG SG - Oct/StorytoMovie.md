### **Agentic AI: From Story to "Movie"**

---

### **Overall Summary**
Building agentic AI applications, using the example of transforming a simple text idea into a professionally structured story and potentially a short video or movie. The process emphasizes breaking down the complex goal into manageable tasks executed by distinct AI agents or tools, leveraging Google's generative AI models and frameworks like the Agent Development Kit (ADK). Key takeaways include:

1. **Goal Decomposition:** The core idea is to transform user text into a story with defined characters, settings, and plots. This requires **deconstructing** the initial idea into specific components (character profiles, images, scene details, keyframes, scripts).
2. **Agentic Workflow Design:** Identify core **actions (verbs)** needed, such as *deconstruct*, *create*, *generate*, and *combine*. These verbs are then mapped to specific **agents or tools** within a larger workflow, determining how agents are triggered and interact (planning/reasoning process).
3. **Leveraging Frameworks (ADK):** The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is highlighted as a powerful framework for building these applications. It supports defining agents and tools, orchestrating interactions using patterns like **sequential** and **parallel processing**, and implementing fine-grained control via **callbacks** at various stages.
4. **Model Selection & Prompt Optimization:** Choose appropriate foundation models based on the task (e.g., Gemini for text generation, Imagen Flash for character-consistent images, VideoFX for video generation). Utilize tools like Vertex AI's **Prompt Optimizer** to systematically improve prompts using labeled examples and metric-based evaluation.
5. **Iterative Evaluation & Deployment:** Emphasize a continuous cycle of building, **evaluating**, and refining. Evaluation methods include human review, using an **LLM-as-judge** (like Gemini) for automated rating and feedback, and calculating specific metrics (e.g., tool precision, success rate) using services like Vertex AI Evaluation Service. Deployment involves considerations for security, compliance, monitoring, and choosing suitable runtimes (e.g., Cloud Run, GKE).

### **1. Conceptualization: From Idea to Agentic Workflow**

The foundation of building an agentic application lies in translating a high-level goal into a structured, executable plan involving AI components.

* **Initial Idea:** Start with a simple concept, such as turning plain text provided by a non-professional writer into a compelling story or even a movie. Recognize the need for AI to bridge the gap in storytelling, character development, and visual generation skills.
* **Define Core Goals & Components:** Break down the desired output (a story/movie) into essential elements:

  * **Characters:** Descriptions, appearances (clothing, fashion), number of characters.
  * **Setting & Plot:** The environment, narrative structure, and sequence of events.
* **Identify Necessary Actions (Verbs):** Think like a director or producer to identify the key steps (verbs) required to achieve the goal. These verbs will later become the functions of individual agents or tools:

  * **Deconstruct:** Break the initial user text/idea into structured components (characters, setting, plot elements).
  * **Create:** Generate detailed assets based on the deconstructed components (e.g., character profile pictures/first frames for scenes).
  * **Generate:** Produce dynamic content, like short video clips for different parts of the story, incorporating poses, gestures, and scripts.
  * **Combine:** Assemble the generated clips or elements into the final product (the complete story or movie), potentially involving post-processing.
* **Plan Agent Interaction:** Determine the sequence and logic for invoking these actions:

  * What triggers each agent/tool?
  * What is the reasoning or planning process?
  * How is data passed from one agent to the next?

### **2. Implementation: Building Agents with ADK and Google AI**

Once the workflow is conceptualized, the focus shifts to implementation using frameworks and models.

* **Framework Choice (ADK):** The Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) is presented as a suitable framework. ADK facilitates:

  * Defining agents and the tools they can use. Tools encapsulate specific capabilities, like generating character descriptions or calling an image generation model.
  * Orchestrating the flow of execution between agents and models.
* **Leveraging ADK Patterns:** ADK provides pre-built patterns for common agent interactions:

  * **Action-Reasoning Loop:** A basic pattern for agents to process input, reason about the next step, and take action (like calling a tool or responding).
  * **Sequential Processing:** For tasks where steps must happen in order (e.g., generate character description -> generate character image).
  * **Parallel Processing:** For tasks that can run simultaneously to save time (e.g., generating details or keyframes for multiple scenes concurrently).
  * **Hierarchical Routing:** For more complex workflows involving conditional logic or sub-agent delegation.
* **Using Callbacks for Control:** ADK's callback mechanism allows inserting custom logic at various points in the agent's execution cycle (e.g., before/after model calls). This is crucial for:

  * **Validation:** Checking outputs against rules (e.g., ensuring story content is age-appropriate).
  * **Refinement:** Post-processing results (e.g., adding citations to a research report).
  * **Monitoring & Logging:** Tracking agent behavior.
* **Model Selection:** Choosing the right foundation model for each task is critical:

  * **Text Generation (Gemini):** Used for deconstructing ideas, writing story parts, and generating prompts for other models.
  * **Image Generation (Imagen Flash):** Chosen for its **character consistency** feature, allowing the generation of a character image and then modifying only the background for subsequent frames, ensuring the character looks the same across scenes.
  * **Video Generation (VideoFX 3.1):** Leveraged for generating short video clips, potentially using multiple inputs (image, text) for consistency.
  * **Audio Generation (Lyra):** Mentioned for generating background audio/music.
  * **Vertex AI Model Garden:** Emphasized as a resource offering a wide selection (over 200) of Google and open-source models, facilitating experimentation as ADK is model-agnostic.

### **3. Refinement: Prompt Optimization and Evaluation**

Building an effective agentic application is an iterative process requiring rigorous prompt tuning and evaluation.

* **Prompt Engineering:** Develop initial prompts for each agent/task, potentially including instructions and few-shot examples.
* **Prompt Optimization:** Use systematic methods to improve prompt performance:

  * **Vertex AI Prompt Optimizer:** A tool that takes multiple prompt versions and labeled examples (5-10 sufficient) to run evaluations, measure metrics, and suggest optimized prompts or provide better examples.
* **Evaluation Strategy:** Implement robust evaluation for both individual model responses and the agent's overall task execution (trajectory):

  * **Human Evaluation:** Direct review by humans. Useful initially but expensive and not scalable.
  * **LLM-as-Judge:** Using a capable LLM (like Gemini) to rate outputs against instructions or reference examples, providing scores and feedback. Limitations exist for highly complex, multi-agent scenarios.
  * **Automated Metrics:** Defining and calculating objective measures like tool selection accuracy (precision), task success rate, or other custom metrics relevant to the application.
  * **Vertex AI Evaluation Service:** A managed service to run these evaluations (LLM-based or metric-based) at scale and repeatedly.

### **4. Deployment and Operations**

Moving the agentic application to production requires addressing operational concerns.

* **Security & Compliance:** Ensure the application adheres to requirements, such as data caching policies (can caching be disabled if needed?) and data residency (using regional resources).
* **Scalable Evaluation:** Continuously use evaluation services to monitor quality post-deployment.
* **Deployment Runtimes:** Choose appropriate infrastructure for hosting the agent application (built with ADK or other frameworks like LangChain). 
* **Monitoring:** Implement tools and processes to monitor the agent's performance, resource usage, and errors in production.
* **Overall Architecture:** A typical setup involves the agent framework (ADK), foundation models (from Vertex AI or elsewhere), evaluation services, and deployment runtimes, all potentially running on Google Cloud for integration but allowing flexibility.
